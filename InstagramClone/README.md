# Instagram *Clone* App
App with Login/Signup features.
Each user can select which other users he wants to follow. 
Allows the user to post photos which will be available on the user feed to all *followers*.
All data is stored and recieved from a Parse server.
Currently, I do not have the Parse server set up, so for the app to work, properties of a working server need to be passed in **StartedApplication.java** file.
